        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day.<br> We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, <br>some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared <br>belief that each of us has the skills and

             their magic and grow. We've learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that <br>
             are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don't<br>
              always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

        <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new <br> 
            knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff<br>
            -organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production<br>
